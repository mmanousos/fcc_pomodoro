/*-- ASSIGNMENT --*/

Build a Pomodoro Clock

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.


//* DESIGN NOTES *//

- want a pause/stop button
- want a reset button 
(possibly these three can be the same place - pause become stop if paused, becomes reset if stopped ? Then resets to pause when timer is started again)

- want a visual representation of countdown (beyond just numbers?)

- need alert that time is expired
- want option of an audio alert (maybe only one sound choice though so option is off or on)

- need task time and break time
