/*-- ASSIGNMENT --*/

Build a Pomodoro Clock

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.


//* DESIGN NOTES *//

- want a pause/stop button
- want a reset button 
(possibly these three can be the same place - pause become stop if paused, becomes reset if stopped ? Then resets to pause when timer is started again)

- want a visual representation of countdown (beyond just numbers?)

- need alert that time is expired
- want option of an audio alert (maybe only one sound choice though so option is off or on)

- need task time and break time

//* PSEUDOCODE *//

on load, work time set to 25 minutes
on load, break time set to 05 minutes
/*  unnecessary to set them on load - set as 'selected' in HTML instead */

On select of dropdowns, change 'selected' to selected 'value'/option

On start click, button grays out
                timer count down starts 
                
On timer === 0, alert pops up
                alert sound plays
                break time countdown fills display and countdown starts
                
On Pause click, start button refills 
                pause button changes to Stop
                timer count down stops
                
On Stop click, button changes to Reset
On Reset click, timer display goes back to whatever the setting of the work time or break time setting is. 

On alert sound slider click to off position, slider changes to red
                                             alert sound turns off
